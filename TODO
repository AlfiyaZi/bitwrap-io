BACKLOG:
* (for UI) - update pnml parser to retain graphics position information
* after this project can be deployed on amazon lambda will refactor stackdump/marble to match
  * (for marble) re-enable keen.io analytics - test w/ lambda
  * attempt to duplicate functionality by streaming events to s3 for use with Athena
* update twisted plugin to function w/ lmdb or mysql
* work on design work for 'contracts'
  * support inhibitor arcs
    * inhibitors provide basic boolean operations 
  * allow cross-net interaction between elementary nets
    * existing: Event(oid)
    * new: Event(oid, sender=<oid>)

ICEBOX:
* Roadmap to colored coins see README.md
  * Expand DSL to include oid and sender/target notation
* Consider keeping elementary nets as a primary feature.
  * Secondary transactions that cross primary nets are called 'contracts'
