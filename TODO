WIP - refactor to make use of either LMDB or RDS backends
currently pulling parts of bitwrap_lambda into the project

BACKLOG:
* (for UI) - update pnml parser to retain graphics position information

GOAL : try to remove as much Async code without ditching cyclone as rpc base
also try to emulate the AWS_lambda event harness where incoming events have
some extra extraction based on which pipeline they are part of

Long Term: 
Make this lib deployable to either aws-lambda or runable as a docker container w/ similar API/event harness
