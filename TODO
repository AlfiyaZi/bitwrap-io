WIP - refactor api module to better match up to AWS lambda event handler style

BACKLOG:
* (for UI) - update pnml parser to retain graphics position information
* Expand DSL to include oid and sender/target notation
* Roadmap to colored coins see README.md
* after this project can be deployed on amazon lambda will refactor stackdump/marble to match
  * (for marble) re-enable keen.io analytics - test w/ lambda
  * attempt to duplicate functionality by streaming events to s3 for use with Athena

GOAL : try to remove as much Async code without ditching cyclone as rpc base
also try to emulate the AWS_lambda event harness where incoming events have
some extra extraction based on which pipeline they are part of

Long Term: 
Make this lib deployable to either aws-lambda or runable as a docker container w/ similar API/event harness
