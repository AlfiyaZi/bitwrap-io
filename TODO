WIP - fix bug where /machines route doesn't work

refactor to make use of bitwrap-lambda

BACKLOG:
* update pnml parser to retain position information for transitions ( just like places )
* record schema updates in an event stream using *metaschema*
* use x-requested-for to add request ip to message in jsonrpc
